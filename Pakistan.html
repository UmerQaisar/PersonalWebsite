     <h1>Pakistan</h1>
     <p>Pakistan (/ˈpækɪstæn/ (About this sound listen) or /pɑːkɪˈstɑːn/ (About this sound listen); Urdu: پاکستان‎), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Urdu: اسلامی جمہوریہ پاکستان‎), is a country in South Asia and on junction of West Asia, Central Asia and East Asia. It is the fifth-most populous country with a population exceeding 207.77 million people.[17] In terms of area, it is the 33rd-largest country spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). Pakistan has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and its Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China in the far northeast, respectively. It is separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north-west, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.</p>
     
     
     
      <h1>Economy</h1>
      <p>Economists estimate that Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region of the world throughout the first millennium CE, with the largest economy by GDP. This advantage was lost in the 18th century as other regions such as China and Western Europe edged forward.[342] Pakistan is considered a developing country[343][344] and is one of the Next Eleven, a group of eleven countries that, along with the BRICs, have a high potential to become the world's largest economies in the 21st century.[345]</p>

     <h1>Military</h1>
     <p>The armed forces of Pakistan are the eighth largest in the world in terms of numbers in full-time service, with about 617,000 personnel on active duty and 513,000 reservists, as of tentative estimates in 2010.[301] They came into existence after independence in 1947, and the military establishment has frequently influenced in the national politics ever since.[215] Chain of command of the military is kept under the control of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee; all of the branches joint works, co-ordination, military logistics, and joint missions are under the Joint Staff HQ.[302] The Joint Staff HQ is composed of the Air HQ, Navy HQ, and Army GHQ in the vicinity of the Rawalpindi Military District.[303]</p>
       
       
       <h1>Military history</h1>
       <p>Since 1947 Pakistan has been involved in four conventional wars, the first war occurred in Kashmir with Pakistan gaining control of Western Kashmir, (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan), and India capturing Eastern Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir). Territorial problems eventually led to another conventional war in 1965; over the issue of Bengali refugees that led to another war in 1971 which resulted in Pakistan's unconditional surrender of East Pakistan.[312] Tensions in Kargil brought the two countries at the brink of war.[151] Since 1947 the unresolved territorial problems with Afghanistan saw border skirmishes which was kept mostly at the mountainous border. In 1961, the military and intelligence community repelled the Afghan incursion in the Bajaur Agency near the Durand Line border.[313][314]</p>

     <h1>Religion</h1>
    <h2>Islam</h2>
     <p>About 97.0% of Pakistanis are Muslim. Pakistan has the second-largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia.[527][528] The majority of them are Sunni (estimated between 75 and 95%)[529][530][531][532][533] while Shias represent between 5–20%.[529][530][534][535] Pakistan, like India, is said to have at least 16 million Shias.[535][531][536] A PEW survey in 2012 found that only 6% of Pakistani Muslims were Shia.[534]

The Ahmadis, a small minority representing 0.22–2% of Pakistan's population,[537] are officially considered non-Muslims by virtue of the constitutional amendment.[538] The Ahmadis are particularly persecuted, especially since 1974 when they were banned from calling themselves Muslims. In 1984, Ahmadiyya places of worship were banned from being called "mosques".[539] As of 2012, 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-denominational Muslims.[540] There are also several Quraniyoon communities.[541][542]

Sufism, a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large following among the Sunni Muslims in Pakistan, at both the academic and popular levels. Popular Sufi culture is centered around gatherings and celebrations at the shrines of saints and annual festivals that feature Sufi music and dance. Two Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Ali Hajweri in Lahore (c. 12th century)[543] and Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan, Sindh (c. 12th century).[544]</p>
     
     
     
      <h1>Transport</h1>
      <p>The transport industry accounts for ~10.5% of the nation's GDP.[429] Pakistan's motorway infrastructure is better than those of India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, but the train system lags behind those of India and China, and aviation infrastructure also needs improvement.[430] There is scarcely any inland water transportation system, and coastal shipping only meets minor local requirements.[431]


Boeing 737 owned and operated by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). PIA operates scheduled services to 70 domestic destinations and 34 international destinations in 27 countries.
Highways form the backbone of Pakistan's transport system; a total road length of 263,942 kilometres (164,006 miles) accounts for 92% of passenger and 96% of inland freight traffic.[337] Road transport services are largely in the hands of the private sector. The National Highway Authority is responsible for the maintenance of national highways and motorways. The highway and motorway system depends mainly on north–south links connecting the southern ports to the populous provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Although this network only accounts for 4.59% of total road length,[337] it carries 85% of the country's traffic</p>
